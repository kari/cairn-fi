## Province: Whitefort
**Whitefort**, after its "founding" by the great ancestor of the **Earl of White**. The (now dead) locals referred to it as **The Ramparts**, but that name is long forgotten. In the Spring the weather is cold and rainy, in the Summer it is hot and humid, in the Fall it is cool and rainy, and in the Winter it is freezing and hailing.  The **Heart** of the **Province** is **Hope Landing**. Built around a large font of water in an otherwise brackish land, and originally acted as a hub for future explorers and pioneers travelling throughout the region. After years of stymied exploration in the wastelands to the West, folks eventually settled in the capital city. The current ruling Faction (The **Potentate**) makes the city its center of government, while **The Will** hides in the abandoned town of **Dead Margin** on the cliffs to the Southwest.

## Factions

### The Potentate (Government)
- **Base**: **Hope's Landing**. 
#### Advantages
- **Anonymity**: The ruling council speaks only through an anointed subject, **The Whisper**.  
- **Knowledge**: There is little the **Potentate**'s ubiquitous spies do not know.   
- **Authority**: As the ruling faction over the **Province**, _detachments_ of soldiers can be summoned from the villages very quickly.
- **Seneschals**: **The Whisper**, stats as [banshee](/resources/monsters/banshee/), and **Lord Alexey**, stas as [buccaneer](/resources/monsters/buccaneer/).
- **Agenda**: Maintain the stability of the realm by crushing rising threats from other factions. 
  - Deploy newly-garrisoned troops to all roads leading into the Capital, to uncover enemies of the realm through torture and force. 
  - Crush the **The Will** and any other enemies threatening the realm. 
- **Obstacle**: Opposition. **The Will** directly defies the rule of law.

### Earl of White (Noble)
- **Base**: **Hope's Landing**. 
#### Advantages
- **Fealty** of the plains villages and their farms (as detachment, stats as [Bandits](/resources/monsters/bandit/)).

- **Seneschal**: Personal Chamberlain, stats as [Brigand](/resources/monsters/brigand/).
- **Agenda**: Increase his own wealth by eliminating **Lord Alexy**.  
  - Promise this season's crop-yield to the **Under-folk**. In exchange they will raid nearby villages.
  - Bait & assassinate **Lord Alexey**, whose family owns the **Swift Mines**.   
  - Marry the widow **Alexey** and inherit the mines, or buy them at a steep discount.

  - Ally with the **Earl of White** for his food stores, so long as it is convenient.

- **Agenda**: Acquire the **God-thumb**, and use it to restore **Fria The Empty**, then rule the **Provinces**.

  - Command the **Under-folk** to overwhelm the capital and distract the **Potentate**.
