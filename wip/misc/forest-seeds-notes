## Example Forest

### Draw Trails

- We start by creating the structure of our forest, drawing the first dot representing the **Heart** in the central, Southern part of the region.
- We then draw the **trunk**, creating a gentle curve towards the Northwest.
- Then we draw three **branches** extending from the **trunk**, one towards the East (closer to the **Heart**) and the other towards the West and further North. 
- We then draw a single **twig** off of each **branch**.
- We draw a dot at every terminal point. 
- Finally we connect two dots to other trails in our forest.

### Number Dots

- First we assign numbers, starting with the **Heart** at 11. In total, we have 7 dots for the Points: 
- `1` is our **Heart**.
- `2` is at the beginning (or end) of the **trunk**. 
- `4`, `5`, and `6`, are each at the end of a **branch**.
- `3` and `7` are each at the end of **twigs**, to the East and West of the **trunk** respectively. 

### Assign Trail Markers

For each trail we'll roll on the **Trail Markers** table (**d12**):

  - For the **trunk** we got a **6** (_Old Logging Road_).
  - For the Eastern **branch** closest to the **Heart** we got a **3** (_Fae Passage_).
  - For the Western **branch** closest to the **Heart** we got a **4** (_Bandit's Run_).
  - For the Eastern **branch** farthest from the **Heart** we got a **5** (_Pilgrim's Footpath_).
  - For the loopeing trails that we made last, we got a **12** (_War Route_) and a **7** (_Trail Tree_).  

### Assign Trail Spoor

- For each Trail we roll on the [Spoor Types](#spoor-types) table. 
- For the _Old Logging Road_ we rolled a **4** (Enormous Footprints).
- For the _Fae Passage_ we rolled a **12** (Fresh Spiderwebs).
- For the _Bandit's Run_ we rolled a **13** (Archaic Tree Carvings).
- For the _Pilgrim's Footpath_ we rolled an **18** (Swaying Plants).
- For the _War Route_ we rolled a **14** (Dozens of Stone Piles)
- For the _Trail Tree_ we rolled a **13** (Claw Marks).

### Assign Points

Next we'll roll on the provided tables to generate features for each point. First roll a **d20** on the [Special](#special) table to create the **Heart (1)**. We got an **11** (_Elf Queen's Pavilion_).

For each remaining point, we first roll on the [point Types](#point-types) table, then on the associated table:
- **(2)**: We roll a **d6**: a **4** (Hazard). Now we roll a **d12** on the [Hazards](#hazards) table: a **6** (_Thorny Thickets_).
- **(3)**: We roll a **d6**: a **5** (Landmark). Now we roll a **d12** on the [Landmarks](#landmarks) table: an **11** (_Cathedral of Trees_).
- **(4)**: We roll a **d6**: **1** (Settlement). Now we roll a **d12** on the [Settlement](#settlements) table: a **9** (_Monastic Retreat_). We also roll on the [Settlement Features](#settlement-features) table with a **d20**: a **20** (Renowned for its scholars).
- **(5)**: We roll a **d6**: **2** (Ruins). Roll a **d12** on the [Ruins](#ruins) table: a **4** (_Crumbled Crypt_).
- **(6)**: We roll a **d6**: **3** (Lair). Roll a **d12** on the [Lairs](#lairs) table: an **8** (_Goblin Hideaway_).
- **(7)**: We roll a **d6**: **6** (Special). Roll a **d20** on the Special table: a **5** (_Will-o'-Wisps_).

### Create Encounters

Next, we create forest encounters by rolling a **d20** on the [Forest Encounters](#forest-encounters) table for each point.

1. We roll an **8**: _Naiads splashing in a small pond. Their teeth are fanged, like daggers._
2. We roll a **17**: _A dense thicket of thorns, nearly impassable._
3. We roll a **15**: _A wounded animal, whining pitifully as it limps._
4. We roll a **2**: _The remnants of an old watchtower hidden in dense forest growth._
5. We roll a **7**: _A gnarled tree trunk bearing an uncannily carved face on its trunk._
6. We roll a **3**: _A snarling pack of wolves surrounding a fresh kill._
7. We roll a **6**: _A circle of perfect mushrooms. Blue-white wings flutter between._

### Naming

We will now name each point using the [Location Names](#location-names) table. I took some liberties here, smashing together words I liked with other words from the list.

1. **Heart (Elf Queen's Pavilion)**: _Glintleaf Dell_
2. **(Thorny Thickets)**: _Thistlefield_
3. **(Cathedral of Trees)**: _Timbertop Spire_
4. **(Monastic Retreat)**: _Cloister of the Quiet Wood_
5. **(Crumbled Crypt)**: _Shattered Barrow_
6. **(Goblin Hideaway)**: _Mossbreak Nook_
7. **(Will-o'-Wisps)**: _Glimmerglade_

### Naming Our Forest

Finally, we roll on the [Forest Names](#forest-names) table, getting a **4** and then a **6** (or 46) for the adjective, "Luminous". Then we roll again, getting a **10** and a **5** (or 15) for the noun, "Weald." Our forest is called **The Luminous Weald**.

### Conclusion 

#### The Luminous Weald

[![Alt text](/img/2e/forestcrawl.png "Click to embiggen"){:height="80%" width="80%"}](/img/2e/forestcrawl.png)

> I've added a backdrop from the wonderful [Perilous Shores](https://watabou.itch.io/perilous-shores) to give it more flavor. 

#### Trails in The Weald

- _Old Logging Road_: Runs Northwest, connecting **Glintleaf Dell** to **Thistlefield**. Logging tracks cut into the ground the entire length of the trail. Enormous footprints are visible in the caked mud.
- _Fae Passage_: Runs Northeast, an offshoot of the _Old Logging Road_. Connects to **Shattered Barrow** and **Glimmerglade**. The air feels heavy here. Covered in fresh spiderwebs. 
- _Bandit's Run_: Runs West, an offshoot of the _Old Logging Road_. Connects to **Timpertop Spire** and **Mossbreak Nook**. The entry is partly hidden, but ancient tree carvings indicate its presence.
- _Pilgrim's Footpath_: Runs East from the _Old Logging Road_. Ends at the **Cloister of the Quiet Wood**. The comfortable trail is lined by odd, swaying plants line both sides of the trail.
- _War Route_: Connects **Timbertop Spire** to the _Old Logging Road_. The path is wide but heavily pitted here. Stones are stacked along the road in an intrictate arrangement as a memorial to the last war. 
- _Trail Tree_: Connects **Glimmberglade** to the _Pilgrim's Footpath_. A bent tree indicates that there is safety towards the Northeast. Ugly claw marks scar the otherwise healthy tree.  

#### Points of Interest in The Weald

1. **Glintleaf Dell**: The heart of the forest. In the center is a small pond, where Naiads with dagger-like teeth frolic. A palatial stone stage is built on one side, topped by a gold-leaf arch. Here, the Elf Queen meets her subjects.
2. **Thistlefield**: This area is overrun with thick bushes, forming a dense, nearly impassable thicket of thorns. It acts as a barrier of sorts, as just beyond lie the wide meadows of the West.
3. **Timbertop Spire**: A heavily wooded area featuring tall, majestic oak trees arranged in an unnatural yet pleasing pattern, evoking a sense of reverence in its visitors. A wounded animal whines pitifully within this sacred grove.
4. **Cloister of the Quiet Wood**: A monastery repurposed from an old military outpost. The only items allowed beyond the decrepit watchtower standing before it are books, as this particular order is well-known for its scholarly research.
5. **Shattered Barrow**: A collapsed crypt, blanketed in moss and ivy. An uncanny, scarred face is carved into a nearby enormous oak tree.
6. **Mossbreak Nook**: A Goblin hideout, completely obscured by the heavily-mossed trees surrounding it. In a small nearby glade, a pack of snarling wolves surrounds a freshly killed fae-touched deer.
7. **Glimmerglade**: A lovely meadow nestled beneath an impressive willow tree. In the center, blue-white wings flutter about a circle of perfect red mushrooms. At night, Will-o'-Wisps descend from the willow's boughs to feast.

| **1**   | A patch of perfectly round toadstools. Blue-white wings flutter between, their wings humming a hypnotic tune. | A circle of standing stones, overgrown with moss. No grass grows in their shadow.                   |
| **2**   | A dense thicket of thorns, nearly impassable. Something shiny glints just beyond.                             | A fairy circle, covered in black moss. Something about it feels off.                                |
| **3**   | A dryad sits atop a stone, a purple fungus lining her arms. There is a violence to her eyes.                  | A great oak has been felled, perhaps by lightning. A large hole is rent on one side.                |
| **4**   | A gnarled tree trunk with an uncannily carved face on its trunk.                                              | A lone Woodwose stands directly on the path ahead, holding a large stick.                           |
| **5**   | A hillside cave, wafting the scent of damp and decay. Within, a stone statue of some forgotten deity.         | A robed woman is tending to a wounded animal, whispering in its ear.                                |
| **6**   | A massive boulder blocks the path ahead. It is actually a buried troll, turned to stone by the sun.           | A rotted, vine-covered cabin, clearly abandoned long ago. A delicious smell wafts from the window.  |
| **7**   | A patch of quicksand disguised as soft ground. A broken spool of rope lies nearby.                            | A small bearded man argues with a squawking raven. It holds something shiny in its beak.            |
| **8**   | A snarling pack of wolves surround a fresh kill. They are not keen to share.                                  | A tiny hovel is nestled in a tree's roots. The smell of baking bread wafts out.                     |
| **9**   | A spectacular waterfall, spraying rainbows high. A silver horn splits the cascade, its owner obscured.        | A tree, all but consumed by blight. In its boughs, something cries out as if trapped.               |
| **10**  | A trap, hastily set and poorly concealed. It smells strongly of urine.                                        | A trio of satyrs playing and dancing to music. They seem ignorant of any observation.               |
| **11**  | A tree acting as makeshift bridge over a glittering stream. It appears sturdy.                                | A troll sits holding a mirror, engaged in deep conversation with its own reflection.                |
| **12**  | A trio of ravens circle ominously overhead. Suddenly they burst into action, diving down into the bush.       | A windless glade with a large willow at the center. It sways softly, as if to some unseen breeze.   |
| **13**  | A wide river where otters are playing with something shiny. It appears to be a small suit of armor.           | Dozens of smallfolk have setup a market here, trading forest goods. Their wares are impressive.     |
| **14**  | A Woodwife gathers herbs, singing a melancholic song. She disappears into the wood if provoked.               | In the crook of a hollow tree, six ravens squawk and preen. If observed they stare back in silence. |
| **15**  | A wounded animal, whining pitifully and limping. There is intelligence in its eyes.                           | Sleeping peacefully atop two boughs, a giant is snoring. The ground vibrates in response.           |
| **16**  | An old watchtower, hidden by dense forest growth. Something larger looms just around the bend.                | The path ends at a small pond. The water looks pure, but something moves subtly within.             |
| **17**  | Bees swarm protectively around a tree brimming with honeycombs. A cloaked figure silently observes nearby.    | Statues of warriors, their faces lined with horror.                                                 |
| **18**  | Naiads splashing in a small pond. Their teeth are fanged, like daggers.                                       | A maze, invisible save for a faint shimmer.                                                         |
| **19**  | Shadowy figures dart between the trees. Hushed voices call out to one another.                                | Footprints that glow faintly under moonlight, but vanish when touched.                              |
| **20**  | Wild berries grow here in abundance. None have been eaten, not even by birds.                                 | A flower that changes color based on the emotions of those nearby.                                  |
