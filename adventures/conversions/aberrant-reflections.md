# Aberrant Reflections

## General Notes
- This was a very easy adventure to convert. A number or relics are given in the adventure with system neutral descriptions which needed no conversion notes.
- I'm grateful to the #conversions channel on the Cairn Discord for their help, as always. The author, Directsun, was especially helpful.

## Monsters or NPCs

### Djinn

10 HP, 1 Armor, 15 DEX, fists (d10+d8)

- Tall, cloudy humanoids from the plane of air. Highly intelligent, use invisibility and illusions to trick other beings.
- May transform into a whirlwind, sweeping everything on its path.
- Capable of granting a wish per person, the result always is distorted based on the wording of the wish.

### Doppelgooper

Doppelgoopers are poor facsimiles of living things absorbed by **The Fallen**.

- They think they are the original being and have all of their memories and abilities.
- They have a melty, shifting form with additional facial features spread over their bodies.
- They slowly degrade over 2d6 hours, eventually becoming an **Ubelfallen** in a final convulsive burst.

### 	Cecil (a dopplegooper)

â€‹6 HP, 1 Armor, 8 STR, 15 DEX, 6 WIL, dagger (D6) or sword (D8)

### Eamil, The Mirror Shard Golem

12 HP, 2 Armor, 15 STR,  10 DEX, 2 x fists (1d8) or fire breath (d8 + d8 *blast*)

- Fire breath 5' line

### The Fallen

This is a hazard not a monster. It should be obviously dangerous with grasping tentacles, biting mouths, and staring eyes.  Doing 12 Damage will temporarily clear a 10' square. Anything entering a space overgrown with The Fallen must make a DEX save or be absorbed in a frenzied slurry of carnage. A Doppelgooper of the victim is vomited out 1d4 rounds later.

- Flammable, burns slowly while releasing acrid smoke and wailing hideously (attracts Hashara)
- Wilts quickly if doused with Lemon Magics Cleaning Solution (does not wail)
- May appear to die, but regenerates after D6 turns. 

### Flesh Golem

10 HP, 2 Armor, 15 STR,  6 DEX, 2 x fists (d6 + d8)

- A hulking construct of flesh and bone, sewn together and animated.
- Not hostile unless attacked.

### Ghoul

6 HP, 14 STR, 3 WIL, elongated claws jagged teeth (d8+d6)

- Grey-skinned man-things wearing shredded clothes, hunkering over the ground.
- Craves the flesh of the living, as it grows only more powerful with each victim.
- **Critical Damage**: target is paralyzed. The wound turns fatal in a day if not treated by a priest or skilled healer. If not burned, the body will rise as a Ghoul.

### Hashara

5 HP, 1 Armor, 8 STR, claw and bite (d6 + d6) or acid spit (d6) 

- Screech activates an Aberrant mirror portal for a round
- *Acid Spit:* can melt metal or flesh
- *Spider Climb:* Can traverse walls and ceilings as easily as floors.
- **Critical Damage:** victims slowly gain insect-like features over 1d4 days, becoming a Hashara at the conclusion of that time unless given the antidote.

### Tentaghoul

7 HP, 2 Armor 15 STR, tentacles and bite (D8+D8 *blast*)

- A grey undead best with paralyzing tentacles.
- **Critical Damage:**  target is paralyzed. The wound turns fatal in a day if not treated by a priest or skilled healer. If not burned, the body will rise as a Ghoul.

### Ubelfallen

7 HP, 1 Armor, 9 STR, multiple bites (d8 + d8) 

- **Critical Damage:** Ingests its victims before clinging to a surface and becoming **The Fallen**
