# Grave of the Green Flame
- Based on the [original adventure](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/315851/BX6-Grave-of-the-Green-Flame-BX-RPG) by Bill Barsh.
- Conversion by Ryan McCarthy.

## Overview

### Critical Damage
In Cairn, failing a critical damage save typically incapacitates the character. This rule makes _Grave of the Green Flame_ especially deadly, as the module is designed for both solo play and with only a single character. Consider altering rule in most cases, excepting those that relate to special attacks (e.g. poison, blood drain). The special effects may still apply on a failed STR save, but the character is not automatically incapacitated.

## Game Notes
### Adventure Points
The player begin the adventure with 3 Adventure Points.

### Class specific choices.
Several times in the adventure the player is presented with choices only made available to characters of a specific class (ranger, thief, etc.) When running this module with Cairn, a character need only have a relevant background to make these choices (e.g. tracking always succeeds for a PC with a background like Hunter or Ranger).

### Spell scrolls
Roll a 1d100 on Cairn’s spell list to determine what spells are on any scrolls you acquire.
