## Mordekaiser the Merchant

#### Bouquet of red swamp hemlock
STR save to heal 1d4 HP if consumed.

#### Finger bone said to be Saint Orthanc's.
50% chance if invoked to give +2 on a single save, then crumbles to dust.

#### Ornately filgreed silver brooch with a strange black gem.
At night, +1 to start-of-combat DEX saves.

### All other wares as described.

## Demonic Possession and You!
### Possessed Villager
3 HP, 15 STR, 10 DEX, 18 WIL, unnatural strength (d6)
- On failing a STR save against critical damage, 50% chance to avoid critical damage.

### The Soggy Bottom Inn
Hagstooth Mead - If consumed, the drinker has advantage on WIL saves for an hour, after which they have disadvantage on WIL saves for two hours.

### The Blacksmith
#### Black Wyrm Bone Dust Enhancement
- Enhanced weapon becomes slightly magical. If enhanced weapon brings a target's HP to zero, they must succeed in a STR save or take critical damage.

## Ethril's Shack
### Ethril's Body
3 HP, 15 STR, 10 DEX, 18 WIL, unnatural strength (d6)
- On failing a STR save against critical damage, 50% chance to avoid critical damage.

## The Wild Swamp
### Poison Gas Bubble
- Small bubbles begin to rise to the surface of the swamp. If characters continue to disturb the muck, the bubbles will continue growing until they burst, belching toxic gas and dealing 1d6 blast damage.

### Fungal Bug
5 HP, 2 Armor, 10 STR, 12 DEX, 1 WIL, slicing pincers (d8), crushing legs (d6+d6)
- Critical Damage: Fungal Cloud - Lets loose a vicious spray of fungus spores. Make a WIL save or become infected by the Levanian cordyceps, losing 1 WIL per day. When an infected character reaches 1 WIL, they become insane, attacking anything that moves and dealing Fungal Cloud as critical damage. Consuming any hallucinogenic substance kills the cordyceps, ending the effect.

### Spore Field
- A wide patch of fungi stretches out before the party. Disturbing the fungi releases clouds of toxic spores. The first inhalation of these spores reduces characters' HP to zero. Subsequent inhalations deal 1d4 damage to DEX. Going around the fungi increases travel time by one travel turn. Attempting to run through the fungi with no protection will require each character to make a WIL save to hold their breath.

### Snakes of Large Size
3 HP, 1 Armor, 10 STR, 12 DEX, 5 WIL, bite (d4 and poisoned)
- Poisoned characters take 1d4 damage each round for 1d4 rounds

### Three-Headed Giant Snake
5 HP, 2 Armor, 15 STR, 11 DEX, 5 WIL, bite (d8+d8+d8)
- Critical damage - Target is swallowed whole. Swallowed characters take 1d4 damage per turn until dead or cut free.

### Bog Body
- The bog body is lying facedown. If it is holding a weapon, the weapon deals +1 damage on all attack rolls. The weapon is covered in a green, acrid smelling swamp slime that will burn characters' hands for 1d4 STR damage if wielded in battle without rinsing it off.

### Trading with Grix
Grix will trade items for:
- Coins (2d10x10)
- Blood (d6 STR damage)
- Dreams (2 Fatigue, lasts 1d4 days regardless of rest)
- HP Potion: Heals 1d6 STR (not above maximum).
- Magical Beans: Fruit heals 1d6 STR and removes a Fatigue.
- The Demon Box: Requires a WIL save to bind the demon.

## Dangers in the Shadows
### 5. Unnatural Fatigue
Eat a ration or take a -1 on all saves until you do.

### 7.
Footsteps begin to sound hollow, and the ground sinks and sways slightly under each step. If players continue without precaution, they will plunge through the roof of a sunken structure. Characters who fall take d6 STR damage and their wounds become infected, preventing STR recovery until they see a healer or use a recovery method other than resting.

### 8. Shade
2 HP, 8 STR, 14 DEX, 8 WIL, corrupting claws (d4)

### 9. Grasping Pool
A murky, perfectly still pool. A light pulses faintly from the depths. If players disturb the surface, long spidery arms reach out to grab them. Characters who are pulled in take 1d4 damage and must make a STR save to free themselves. Failing this save once results in the character's weapon being stolen and dragged down into the depths. Subsequent failures deal 1d4 damage as the character chokes on the icy water.

### 11. The Consumer
4 HP, 1 Armor, 13 STR, 5 DEX, 7 WIL, claws (d6+d6)
-Critical Damage: Devours target, killing them instantly and gaining 1d4 STR.

### 12. Figment of the Thing
4 HP, 1 Armor, 12 STR, 15 DEX, 18 WIL, corrupt touch (d6)
- Takes half damage from non-silvered weapons.

### The Defiled Sanctuary
### Reverent Corpse
1 HP, 5 STR, 12 DEX, 4 WIL, slam (d4)

### Sealed Relic Room
The chains can be broken in three strikes by a d10 weapon or in 4 strikes by a d8 weapon. After each strike, roll that weapon's damage die. On a roll of 6 or higher, the nearby figures are roused from their stupor and attack!

#### Treasures in the room:
- Silvered Morningstar (d10+1)
- **Silver vial of liquid**: Drink to heal 1d6 STR (not above maximum)

## Corruption
### The THING
6 HP, X STR, 18 DEX, 18 WIL, claws (d6+d6)
- STR = Paranoia x 3 + 3
- Normal weapons do half damage, silvered or magical weapons deal full.
- The THING also can perform the following special attacks. Each special attack can be used only once and then cannot be used again until it is recharged.

### Consumed by Corruption
Target has -2 on all rolls. Target can make a WIL save to rid themselves of the corruption, but failing the save causes them to fall into a stupor for 1d4 rounds.
- **Mirrored Image:** Takes on the image of a party member, sowing confusion. Lasts until the THING is hit. Recharges on a roll of 5 on any d6 roll.
- **Ripples in the Void:** 1d6 blast damage. Recharge on a roll of 6 on any d6 roll.
- **Banish the THING**: If the Orphan is not present, or if she is dead or incapacitated, the THING will target the party member that appears to be the weakest.
- Grix's box takes three turns to use. On the second turn, the user may make a WIL save to complete the ritual a turn early. On a failure, the box lashes out at the user's mind, dealing 1d4 WIL damage, and the ritual must be started from the beginning.
