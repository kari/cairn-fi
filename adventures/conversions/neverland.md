# Neverland

- Based on the [Neverland](https://publishing.andrewsmcmeel.com/book/neverland-a-fantasy-role-playing-setting/) by [Andrew Kolb](https://www.kolbisneat.com/).
- Conversion by [David Schirduan](https://www.technicalgrimoire.com/].

## General Notes
- I tried to be as consistent as possible when converting creatures. But some of the 5e stats are a little silly, so you will probably want to tweak things a bit. E.g. Peter Pan probably doesn't need crazy high stats.
- These stats don't include the FULL statblock, please consult the text for additional abilities and details.
