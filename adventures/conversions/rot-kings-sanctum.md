# Rot King's Sanctum 
- Based on the [The Rot King's Sanctum](https://emielboven.itch.io/rot-king) by [Emiel Bovien](https://emielboven.itch.io/rot-king).
- Conversion by [Pat Eyler](https://footofthemountainadventures.blogspot.com/)

## General Notes
- I created this conversion using both the DURF and OSR editions of the Rot King's Sanctum so I could run this as a trial adventure for a potential upcoming Cairn campaign.  Yochai Gal was very helpful in improving this conversion.
- Stats for *Melvin* are from the Gnome and stats for the *Shadow* in the Monsters list on the [Cairn RPG Website](https://cairnrpg.com/resources/monsters/).
- Stats for *Wererat* are based on those created by @mapolon on the Cairn RPG Discord
