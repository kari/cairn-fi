# Manticore

6 HP, 15 STR, 14 DEX, 12 WIL, claws (d6+d6) or tail spike (d6)

- Spiteful monstrosities that wear a humanoid face, a lion's body, wings of a bat, and a scorpion's tail. Dwell in mountainous regions, abandoned castles, and forgotten dungeons.
- Tail spikes act like darts, regrowing after a few days. A single spike is worth 150gp to a collector.
- **Critical Damage**: Target is _deprived_ until they get a good night's sleep. Until then, they act boorish, selfish, and cruel (or more so, if that already is their nature).
