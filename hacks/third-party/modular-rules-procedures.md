## Dungeon Exploration

### Dungeon Turns 
A dungeon turn is approximately 10 minutes. Dungeon exploration can be turned into a subsystem of managing resources, making strategic decisions, and structuring the dungeon crawl into a sort of mini-game. There is an element of pushing your luck as you spend more time searching, checking for hidden things, and lingering in dangerous locations. Time spent always has a cost, and that cost is provoking an encounter roll. These encounters can involve running into monsters, but can also challenge or reward the party in other ways. 

### Sequence of Player Per Turn 
**1. Encounter Roll:** GM makes a d6 loaded encounter roll once every few dungeon turns, or at their discretion.  
**2. Actions:** The party decides what action to take. (e.g. moving, searching, listening, entering or exiting rooms).   
**3. Description:** GM describes & resolves what happens. If encounters were rolled, they happen here. If (1) was rolled on the encounter die, make a reaction roll and proceed from there.   
**4. End of turn:** GM updates time, and management of light, food, need to rest, or any sort of usage dice rolls can be made. 

### Dungeon Turn Movement 
Players can move **carefully** about 200 ft. in a 10 minute turn.  Players moving carefully spot signs of all traps. Traps should be designed to be disarmed or subverted with ingenuity and creative thinking using common sense and inventory. Players can quickly move 600 ft. in a 10-minute turn. Players moving **quickly** may get a chance to roll under WIL to notice a trap (GM discretion). Otherwise, they may trigger a trap if it is concealed (usually 1-2 on a d6, adjust as necessary for trap deadliness).

### Searching
- A quick search takes 1 minute, covers roughly a 30x30’ space, and reveals only the most obvious information.
- A detailed search takes 10 minutes (1 turn), covers roughly a 30x30’ space, and reveals most hidden information.
- You can replace 30x30 with small, medium, and large rooms, and require additional turns to complete a detailed search.

### Loaded Encounter Roll 
- Roll a d6 encounter dice every 2 or 3 rounds (at your discretion, adjust as needed) or when players make noise. 
- Only a roll of 1 will result in an encounter, and they won’t always be hostile. 
- Roll the reaction dice to see their disposition, and remember that they’re already doing something. 
- Optionally, you can roll non-loaded encounters with only and encounter occurring on a roll of 1, while nothing else happens otherwise.

**1. Encounter** (roll on encounter table or choose, roll reactions + wants)  
**2. Sign** (Clue, “spoor”, track, abandoned lair, scent, victim, droppings, etc.)  
**3.  Locality** (context-dependent timer, water rising, ritual completing, The party's surroundings shift or escalate in some way.)  
**4. Exhaustion** (rest next round or deprived)  
**5. Expiration** (Ongoing effects end, light usage roll, resource usage, bellies rumble.)  
**6. Discovery or Treasure** (The party finds something interesting and possibly beneficial.)  

### Light 
Torches, lanterns, and other radial sources of light illuminate 40’ clearly and provide dim outlines and shadows for a further 40’. In the dark, light sources are visible miles away. Standard torches will last about 6 turns, or 1 hour, before they burn out.

## Wilderness Exploration

### Hex Crawling
Each hex represents 6 miles. An adventuring day is divided into 6 turns of approximately 4 hours each. Two of these phases, approximately 8 hours, must be spent sleeping in order to avoid becoming deprived. In each turn, the following procedure is followed:  
**1. Exploration Action:** The party decides on one exploration action for that turn.  
**2. Event Roll:** The GM rolls on the event die for encounters and other random events.  
**3. Resolution:** The action and event rolls are resolved.  

### Wilderness Exploration Actions
The party may choose one of the following standard actions each 4-hour wilderness turn.  

- **Travel:** Exiting a hex and moving into an adjacent one.  
- **Roads:** The party travels through two tiles (three if mounted).  
- **Standard Terrain:** 1 tile is traversed.  
- **Difficult Terrain:** ½ tile is traversed. (requires 8 hours, or 2 turns)  
- **Treacherous Terrain:** ¼ tile is traversed. (requires 16 hours, or 4 turns)   
- **Getting Lost:** There is a 1-in-6 chance, when traveling off-road, of getting lost. This is increased to 2-in-6 in tiles classified as difficult or treacherous. An experienced woodsman or explorer decreases the chance of getting lost by 1-in-6.  
- **Off-Course:** When lost, assign a number to each adjacent tile starting from the top (north) as 1, continuing clockwise. Roll 1d6 and move the players one tile off-course that direction.   
-  **Reorientation:** If players get lost, they will need to spend the next turn reorienting themselves.  
- **Weather:** Adverse weather can optionally increase the chances of getting lost or the difficulty of the terrain.   
- **Explore:** Looking for interesting features within a hex. There is a 4-in-6 chance of discovering the main location in the hex description. Difficult terrain reduces this to 3-in-6. An experienced woodsman increases the chance by 1-in-6.  
- **Locate:** Looking for something which was previously encountered in a hex. The basic chance is 5-in-6 or 4-in-6 in difficult terrain. An experienced woodsman, tracker, or navigator increases the chance by 1-in-6.  
- **Interact:** Staying in the current location (e.g. exploring a dungeon, town, etc).  
- **Camp:** Resting and/or sleeping.  
- **Forage:** Hunt, fish, or forage for food. There is a basic 3-in-6 chance of success. An experienced hunter, angler, or woodsman increases the chance.  

### Event Roll 
The GM rolls a **d6** and consults the table appropriate to the party’s location.

**1. Encounter:** Roll on an encounter table for that terrain type or location. Don’t forget to roll for reaction and want.  
**2. Sign:** Clue, spoor, or indication of nearby encounter, locality, hidden feature, or information about a nearby hex.  
**3. Locality:** Shifts in weather, terrain, or other local changes.  
**4. Expiration:** Resources are drained in some way. Roll a d4.  
- 1-2: Exhaustion (rest for a turn or add 1 fatigue)  
- 3-4: Hunger (Eat a ration or add 1 fatigue)  

**5. Discovery:** Discover something useful such as food, treasure, or other resources.  
**6. Hidden Feature:** The main feature of the hex is discovered, or, choose or roll randomly for a unique hex feature from a random table. Options include small dungeons, secret areas, factions, etc. If none apply, this result is simply a free turn.

## Reactions
When the PCs encounter an NPC whose reaction to the party is not obvious, the Warden may roll 2d6 and consult the following table.


|         |      |         |          |         |
| ------- | ---- | ------- | -------- | ------- |
| 2       | 3-5  | 6-8     | 9-11     | 12      |
| Hostile | Wary | Curious | Friendly | Helpful |

## What Do They Want?
Most NPCs will have something they want. Roll a d10 on the following table to find out what they want.

|     |      |             |
| --- | ---- | ----------- |
| d10 | Want | Description |
1 | **Food** | You can distract them with rations, point them towards corpses, cast a food illusion.
2 | **Aid** | They could be hurt and need medical aid of some sort.
3 | **Gold** | They want money. Extortion, toll, tax, tribute, or greed.
4 | **Valuables** | Rare or unique items. Excellent pairings can result in their friendship or gaining as allies.
5 | **Territory** | This is their turf. They will defend it, ask you to leave, or to prove why you should be able to pass through.
6 | **Info** | They want to know about a nearby NPC, faction, landmark, or location.
7 | **Help** | They need something from nearby, probably somewhere dangerous. Kill something, clear out an area, retrieve something.
8 | **Trade** | They have random equipment (from each category on the equipment tables) and want to trade or sell. 1 in 6 chance they have something rare or valuable. Good business means possible friendship.
9 | **Mission** | They're in service to another nearby NPC or faction and are helping to achieve a goal for them.
10 | **Directions** | They are lost and need directions somewhere, or help being escorted there safely.

## Leveling Up

### Experience Points (XP)
Gain a new level every 1,000 XP. Optionally increase the XP needed each level. A good place to start is adding between 500-1,000 XP each level. 

### Gaining XP 
Experience points are gained at a rate of 1 XP for every 1 gold (or your game’s standard currency) retrieved and returned to the safety of a town or your base of operations. 

### Increasing HP & Ability Scores 
Each time you level up:
- Roll 1d6 and add to your HP total.
- Re-roll each Ability Score with 3d6. If a result is higher than your current score, increase that Ability Score by 1.

## Carousing
You can spend your hard-earned credit on experiences rather than on things. Carousing lets you double-dip your experience by spending it at a 1-1 ratio. The more you spend, the more impactful or eventful your experience. Carousing represents having a good time, donating your money, investing in a “business opportunity”, or some other experience involving your wealth and blowing off steam. Alter these tables or add your own mishaps and fortunes. They generally represent getting into shenanigans while inebriated but can also be sober celebratory outcomes. 

### Carousing Roll 
Declare the amount of gold you’re spending and roll 2d6 to see how your evening went.

|     |                                                                                                                          |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 2d6 | How Things Went                                                                                                          |
| 2-5 | Mishap: Experience is gained, but you've all made fools of yourself in some manner. Roll on the carousing mishaps table. |
| 6-9 | Responsible Time: Experience is gained and you all kept things reasonably sane.                                          |
| 10+ | Fortune: Experience is gained, and you've all had a stroke of good luck! Roll on the carousing fortunes table.           |

### Mishaps & Fortunes Table
- Roll 1d6, adding + 1 to the results for every 100 GP you carouse with. Larger cities should allow for (or require) more money to be spent. More decadent partying comes with the potential of more volatile or legendary consequences. 
- Alternatively, just roll a 1d12 and check the results.

| 1      | **Start a brawl.** You all are involved in a brawl that gets out of control. Start the next adventure with a black eye and -1 STR per level. The local tavern keeper is no longer quite as amicable.                                                                                                                             | **Jackpot!** One of you strikes it rich at the gambling tables! Gain level x 100 gold. (Or 1D6 x 100 if playing without levels)                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 2      | **Minor misunderstanding** with local authorities that you’re unable to smooth over. You all spend the next 1d6 days in jail. Now seen as local troublemakers.                                                                                                                                                                   | **Gain a local reputation** as the life of a party! Those of ill repute are much more friendly and see you as one of their own.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 3      | One of you **insulted a local person of rank.** They will hold a grudge unless you all publicly apologize and humiliate yourself before them.                                                                                                                                                                                    | **Whoa what a trip!** The strange powder you sniffed revealed mystic truths about the universe. Young people in the settlement see you as cool and not one of the squares. (Optional: gain a random spell or generate a Maze Rats spell, either one-use or permanent.)                             |
| 4      | **Hangover from hell.** The first 2d6 hours adventuring the next day are done with disadvantage to all STR saves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                | **Well fed, well rested, and ready to go!** The next day of adventuring all saves are done with advantage.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 5      | **Gambling binge.** Your party owes a collective debt equal to roughly half the amount spent carousing to someone you’d rather not own money to.                                                                                                                                                                                 | **Citizens arrest!** You catch some criminal in the act and are able to restrain them until the authorities arrive. You are seen as hero’s by the settlement for a short time.                                                                                                                     |
| 6      | **You’ve ruined the local economy!** Your excess spending means that all prices are now double until next session.                                                                                                                                                                                                               | **The local blacksmith**, due to your influx of cash, has been able to order in an exquisite weapon that he’s willing to sell to you guys for the normal price.                                                                                                                                    |
| 7      | **Major misunderstanding** with local authorities.

### Gaining Vices 
Players can roll for a vice during character creation, or acquire one through the fiction of play. Roll a D10 for a random vice. Otherwise, consult the triggers for suggestions on what might trigger a character to develop a vice. You can require them failing a WIL save after hitting a trigger if you wish. Alternatively they can willingly take on a vice they find interesting.
