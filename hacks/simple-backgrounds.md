# Simple Backgrounds

### Dwellers of the Underground
- **Darkvision**: Perfect vision in low-light, somewhat blinded by bright lights.
- **Rocksniff**: You always know the location of nearby jewels and minerals.
- **Earthhardy**: You are tougher than sun-dwellers, often recovering from injuries or poison thought to be lethal.

### Fair Folk
- **Magic-Sense**: You can tell when arcane energies are at work, and where.
- **Third Eye**: You cannot be fooled by magical illusions, save those created by one of your own.
- **Fae Cunning**: Whether by the reputation of your people or some ancient ways other-kind cannot lie to you.

### Smallfolk
- **Easily Missed**: Enemies tend to ignore you, going for the bigger targets first or ignoring you altogether.
- **Quicksilver**: Escaping sudden capture or a killing blow is like second nature to you. Sneaking comes naturally, too.
- **Second Breakfast**: You have to eat _a lot_, at least 5 times a day. Fortunately you can consume nearly anything if you have to.

### Greenskin
- **Blood Brothers**: Being surrounded by at least two other trusted warriors bolsters your battle sense, and you always go first.
